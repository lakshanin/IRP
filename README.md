# MultiTaskConformer for English Pronunciation Assessment for Non-Native Speakers

This project implements a Multi-Task Conformer model designed for detailed pronunciation assessment. The model performs both phoneme recognition via Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and error classification through Cross-Attention mechanisms. The system includes end-to-end pipelines for data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and inferencing with a simple user interface built using Streamlit.
